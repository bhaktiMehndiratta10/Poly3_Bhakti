# Logical Gate Circuit Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of a logical gate circuit using the Circom programming language. The circuit implements a logic gate that takes two inputs, A and B, and produces an output based on the following condition: A (0) and B (1) yield a 0 output.

## Usage

 `npm install`.

`npx hardhat circom`. This command will generate the intermediaries needed for proving the correctness of the circuit.

 `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network goerli`.
